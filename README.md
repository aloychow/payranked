# PayRanked: Jobs & Company Aggregator

Company and job transparency have been at an all-time low, with employers trying to prevent salary discussions among employees, and the lack of company and job specific information available on the internet. This poses a huge problem to the vast majority of job seekers. PayRanked aims to put the power back into the hands of job seekers by promoting job transparency in the workplace.

Payranked uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative metrics like salary, work-life balance, and many more to help job seekers find their dream job. 

## Multi-Pronged Approach

1. **Full Transparency**: Transparency in the workplace helps to align employees expectations, ensuring that every individual is fairly compensated. It also leads to happier and healthier employees. Stop pay discrimination now!
2. **Cohesive Evaluation**: Jobs are not only about money. We use various metrics to evaluate jobs and companies - comprising not only extrinsic metrics like compensation, but intrinsic ones like work-life balance and culture.
3. **Complete Anonymity**: All your company-related information is encrypted and untraceable - not even by us! Share your experiences at your company with other people without worrying at all.
